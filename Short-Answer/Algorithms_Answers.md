#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 

runtime is O(n) (linear). Runtime is linear bc we increment "a" which will touch every number until we reach a = n * n * n


b)

runtime is O(n) (linear). Our runtime is based on the size of n and we touch every every element in range atleast one time.

c) 

runtime is O(c^n) more specifically O(1^n) n being the size of our input (bunnines)
and 1 / c (constant) being the number of times that we call our selves from the start of our recursive calls.
